> [!NOTE]  
> This project is a work in progress. I'm picking this up in my free time as and when I can.

## Development

To run simulations, view waveforms, and flash Lattice/Gowin FPGAs, you'll need
the latest version of the [OSS CAD suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build). For Xilinx FPGAs, Vivado is required.

All Makefiles rely on the `$ROOT` variable being set, which you can get by
sourcing the appropriately named `sourceme` file.

Full information on running simulations and the project setup are available on
the [project page](https://matiasilva.github.io/riscv-soc/tools.html).
