\section{Introduction}

In this class, we covered the following items:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=6pt]
\item Motivation behind software resets
\item How to execute a software reset on the MPU6050
\item Interacting with the i2c hardware on the Pico
\item Understand the bitwise shift operators
\end{itemize}

I'll briefly explain these again here to eliminate any doubt.
