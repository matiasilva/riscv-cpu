\section{Motivation}

My goals with this project were:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item to understand the inner workings of an SoC intimately
	\item to understand the role of each tool involved in a tapeout
	\item to understand the hardware stack from the bottom up: gates to kernel to userland software
\end{enumerate}

When I first started working in chip design back in my 2021 summer internship, I realized that this was a unique industry to get into. 

As weeks went by at my day job, I noticed that there is an immense aversion to risk in the chip industry. New and better methods were cropping up all the time but there was seemingly no interest in taking up these new developments.
