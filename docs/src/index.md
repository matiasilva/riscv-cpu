## Contents

This webpage documents my learning journey while working on my Minimal RISC-V
SoC project, which I started in 2024. Aside from that, it also contains a formal
datasheet, notes on microarchitecture choices, my testing infrastructure and
more. My hope is that having a project guide from start to end will help others
dust their FPGAs off and get to work designing cool hardware.

```{note}
This documentation is also available to download as a PDF.

My main goals with the project were to:

1. develop a deeper understanding of digital design, verification and compilers
1. apply modern software methodologies to hardware design
1. learn about RISC-V
