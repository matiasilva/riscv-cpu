# Motivation

My goals with this project were:

1. to understand the inner workings of an SoC intimately
1. to understand the role of each tool involved in a tapeout
1. to understand the hardware stack from the bottom up: gates to kernel to userland software

When I first started working in chip design back in my 2021 summer internship, I realized that this was a unique industry to get into.

As weeks went by at my day job, I noticed that there is an immense aversion to risk in the chip industry. New and better methods were cropping up all the time but there was seemingly no interest in taking up these new developments.
